Time series
---
engineer features to model the major time series components
visualize time series with many kinds of time series plots
create forecasting hybrids that combine the strengths of complementary models
adapt machine learning methods to a variety of forecasting tasks.


Linear Regression with Time Series
--

 time series: a setof observations recorded over time.

 Linear regression algorithm learns how to make a weighted sum from its input features

 Time-step features are features which we can derive directly from the time index.

 Time-dummy counts off the time steps in the series from the bgining to end


-----

Trend
--

The trend component of a time series represents a persistent, long-term change in the mean of the series.

The trend is the slowest-moving part of a series, the part representing the largest time scale of importance.

    Moving Average Points
    ---
    TO compute a moing average of a time series, we compute the average of the values within a sliding window of some defined width. 
    Each point on the graph represents the avergae of all the values in the series that fall within the window on either side.

    Engineering Trend
    ---
    y = target
    x = time
    m = a
    b = constant

    y = mx + b
    y = mx^2 * x + c


    Deterministioc Process : a technical term for a time series that is non random or completely determined


---

Seasonality
--

we say a time series exhibits seasonality whenever there is a regular, periodic change in the mean of the series.

    Indicators
    -
    A seasonal plot shows segments of time plotted against soem common period, The period being the "season" you want to observe.

    Seasonal Indicators are binary features that represent seasonal differences in the level of a time series. 

    Seasonal  indicators is what you get when you treat a seasonla period as a categorical feature and apply one-hot encoding


    Fourier Features and the Periodogram
    ---
    This features are better suited for long seasons over many observations where indicators would be impractical.

    Fourier features are pairs of sine and cosine curves, one pair for each for the potential frequency in the season starting with the longest.

    periodogram
    (a ** 2 + b **2 ) / 2
    a and b are the coefficients of the sine and cosine at that frequency.

Time Series as Features
---

    Cycles
    -
    These are patterns of growth and decay in a time series associated with how the value in a series at one time depends on values at previous times, but not necessarily on the time step itself.

    Lagged Series and Lag Plots
    -
    Lagging a time series means to shift its vaues forward one or more steps, or equivalently, to shift the time index backward one or more steps. 

    Lag plots
    -
    A lag plot of a time series shows its values plotted against its lags. 
    Autocorrelation : - the correlation a time series has with one of its lags.

    Choosing Lags
    -

Hybrid Models
--

    Components and Residuals
    ---

    series = trend + seasons + cycles + error

    The residuals of a model are the difference between the target the model was trained on and the predictions the model makes.


    Hybrid Forecasting with Residuals
    --

    The method of using predictions as features is known as stacking.
    The method of fitting residuals is actually the same method the gradient boosting algorithm uses.

Forecasting With Machine Learning
--

There are two things to establish before designing a forecasting model:

 - What information is available at the time a forecast is made (features), and,
 - The time period during which you require forecasted values(target).

The forecast origin is time at which you are making a forecast

The forecast horizon is the time for which you are making a forecast.

The time between the origin and the horizon is the lead time(latency) of the forecast.

    Multistep Forecatsing Strategies
    --

    - Multioutput model
        :: Use a model that produces multiple outputs naturally.

    - Direct Strategy
        :: Train a separate model for each step in the horizon

    - Recursive Strategy
        :: Train a single one-step model and use its forecasts to update the lag fetaures for the next step.

    - DirRec startegy
        :: A combination of the direct and recursive startegies: train a model for each step and use forecats from previous steps as new lag features.
